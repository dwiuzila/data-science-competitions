# Source Codes for Some Data Science Competitions

As part of my learning process in data science, I joined several past competitions in [Kaggle](kaggle.com) and [Drivendata](drivendata.org), then draft the best solutions:

1. [Ames House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques): The famous Ames Housing Dataset fresh from Kaggle brought to you by ensembling 7 simple models
2. [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic): A really simple yet powerful decision tree model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers
3. [MNIST Digit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer): Recognize hand-written digit from MNIST dataset by ensembling 15 CNNs
4. [Box-Plots](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/4/box-plots-for-education/): Hardcore solution for Box-Plots for Education, a competition from Drivendata
5. [Favorita Grocery Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting): Forecast product sales from Corporaci√≥n Favorita using a Light GBM model
6. [Mercari Price Suggestion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge): Suggest product prices to online sellers in Mercari, a Japan's shopping app, by ensembling 4 NN models
7. [Santander Customer Transaction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction): Identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted, using a customized fast.ai TabularModel
8. [Web Traffic Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting): Forecast future traffic to Wikipedia pages using keras NN model
9. [Rinse Over Run](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/56/predict-cleaning-time-series/): Predict turbidity in the last rinsing phase of the cleaning stations at Food & Beverage industry using Catboost, in order to help minimize the use of water, energy and time, while ensuring high cleaning standards
10. [Forecasting Energy Consumption](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/51/electricity-prediction-machine-learning/): Forecast energy consumption from little data using RandomForest & ExtraTrees
11. [Shopee Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/opn-rd2-acv): Find fake orders where the buyer and the seller are directly or indirectly linked and output the shortest link between the buyer and the seller

Each of these solutions is presented in a jupyter notebook. There aren't many comments in it for now, may be added on future occasions.

Thanks!
